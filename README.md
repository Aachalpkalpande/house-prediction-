 House Price Prediction Mode2
This repository contains a simple House Price Prediction model implemented using Python. The project follows a structured process, including data cleaning, model development using Ridge regression, and the creation of a web-based user interface using Flask.

Key Components
## Data Cleaning: The dataset undergoes cleaning to handle missing values, categorical data, and other preprocessing steps.

## Model Development: The machine learning model is implemented using Ridge regression, leveraging the scikit-learn library. The trained model is saved for later use.
